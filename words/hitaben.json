{"word":"hitaben","pos":"adverb","senses":[{"glosses":["addressing"]}],"etymology":"Inherited from Ottoman Turkish خطابا (hitaben), from Arabic خِطَابًا (ḵiṭāban), adverbial accusative of خِطَاب (ḵiṭāb, “speech”). By surface analysis, hitap (“speech”) + -en. Compare Azerbaijani xitabən and Uzbek xitoban."}
