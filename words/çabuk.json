{"word":"çabuk","pos":"adverb","senses":[{"glosses":["quickly, soon"],"synonyms":["hemen","hızlıca"]}],"pronunciation":"/t͡ʃaˈbuk/","etymology":"Inherited from Ottoman Turkish چابوق (çabuk, çabık), چابق (çabuk, çabık), چاپق (çapuk, çapık), چاپوق (çapuk, çapık). Cognate with or derived from Persian چابک (čâbok), if not from Ottoman Turkish چاپمق (çapmak, “to run, trot”). Nişanyan suggests a Turkic origin for the Persian, but existence of older Iranian forms makes that doubtful. The word may have entered Turkic before the first written records of the language family. The alternative Ottoman pronunciation چابك (çabük), چاپك (çapük), چاپوك (çapük) is probably a reborrowing from Persian.","forms":[{"form":"çabık","tags":["alternative"]},{"form":"çapık","tags":["alternative"]},{"form":"çevik","tags":["alternative"]}]}
