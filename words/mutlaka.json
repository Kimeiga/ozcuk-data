{"word":"mutlaka","pos":"adverb","senses":[{"glosses":["definitely, absolutely, unconditionally"],"synonyms":["kesinlikle","muhakkak","elbette","katiyen"]}],"pronunciation":"/ˈmut.ɫa.kaː/","etymology":"Inherited from Ottoman Turkish مطلقا (mutlaka, “absolutely”), derived from Arabic مُطْلَقًا (muṭlaqan), adverbial accusative of مُطْلَق (muṭlaq, “absolute”). The form in /aː/ represents the Arabic pausal pronunciation (as also in evvela or mesela). By surface analysis, mutlak (“absolute”) + -an (adverbial suffix)."}
