Found as Old Turkic [script needed] (-lar) (back variant) but not found in the sister Oghur branch (compare Chuvash -сем (-sem), Bulgar ـڛَم), where it descended from *sāyïn (“every”). The Chuvash plural suffix, however, lacks vowel harmony unlike other suffixes.","forms":[{"form":"no-table-tags","tags":["table-tags"]},{"form":"tr-suffix-forms","tags":["inflection-template"]},{"form":"-lar","tags":["error-unrecognized-form"]},{"form":"-ler","tags":["error-unrecognized-form"]}]}
