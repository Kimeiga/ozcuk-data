{"word":"müq","pos":"adjective","senses":[{"glosses":["excellent"],"tags":["Internet","slang"],"examples":[{"text":"şarkın müq abi","translation":"your song is excellent man"}]}],"pronunciation":"/ˈmyc/","etymology":"Clipping of mükemmel. The choice of Q is most likely due to it being out of place, and therefore strange or humorous, as it is not found in the Turkish alphabet natively. Note that the addition of q does not change the pronunciation, and is simply pronounced as a /k/."}
