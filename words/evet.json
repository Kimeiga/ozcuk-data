{"word":"evet","pos":"particle","senses":[{"glosses":["yes"],"synonyms":["beli","ha","he","oldu","olur","peki","tamam","ya"]}],"pronunciation":"/e.vet/","etymology":"From Ottoman Turkish أوت (evet), from Proto-Common Turkic. Cognate with Karakhanid [script needed] (yemet, “yes”). Nişanyan suggest that it may be a doublet of dialectal evet (“quickly”) and suggests a derivation from Proto-Turkic *ẹ̄b- (“to be quick”) whence ivmek, however note the mismatch in initial vowels. EDAL considers Chuvash аван (avan) to also be a cognate and reconstructs Proto-Turkic *ebe-, however such a root is unattested and usually not reconstructed outside of EDAL.\nReplaced the formerly prevalent ha (“yes”), now largely limited to dialectal and colloquial use."}
