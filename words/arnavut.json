{"word":"Arnavut","pos":"proper-noun","senses":[{"glosses":["Albanian (person)"]}],"etymology":"Borrowed as Ottoman Turkish آرناود (arnavud) from the Byzantine Greek ethnonym Ἀρβανίτης (Arbanítēs), after the syllable cluster van was rearranged through metathesis to nav giving the final Turkish forms as Arnavut and Arnaut. The Greek ethnonym is derived from the original term Ἀλβανίτης (Albanítēs) as a process of rhotacism, turning Alv- into Arv-. The original ethnonym stems from the name Ἀλβάνος (Albános, “Albanian”), from Ancient Greek Ἀλβανοί (Albanoí)."}
