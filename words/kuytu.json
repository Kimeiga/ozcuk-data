{"word":"kuytu","pos":"adjective","senses":[{"glosses":["dark, quiet and secluded place"]}],"etymology":"Inherited from Ottoman Turkish قویتو (koytu). Further etymology uncertain. Three possibilities have been proposed:\n* From Middle Mongol ᠬᠣᠢᠲᠤ (qoitu, “behind; to the north”) (Modern Mongolian хойд (xojd) / ᠬᠣᠶᠢᠳᠤ (qoyidu)). Compare kuz (“place not under sunlight, shadowed hillside”) and kuzey (“north”) for the semantic parity with \"north\" <> \"secluded\".\n* A native Turkic word with sparse attestation, if so, would be cognate with Karakhanid [script needed] (ku:y, “bottom of a valley”), Tuvan куй (kuy, “cave”) and Khakas хуй (xuy, “cave”).\n* From Ancient Greek κοїθε (koїthe, “seaside”)."}
