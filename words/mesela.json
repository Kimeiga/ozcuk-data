{"word":"mesela","pos":"adverb","senses":[{"glosses":["for example"],"synonyms":["örneğin"]}],"pronunciation":"/me.se.laː/","etymology":"Inherited from Ottoman Turkish مثلا (mesela), derived from Arabic مَثَلاً (maṯalan, “for example”), adverbial accusative of مَثَل (maṯal, “example”). The form in /aː/ represents the Arabic pausal pronunciation (as also in evvela or mutlaka). By surface analysis, mesel (“example”) + -a (adverbial suffix)."}
