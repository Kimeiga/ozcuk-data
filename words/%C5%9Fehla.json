The meaning “squinting, squint-eyed” is an invention of Ottoman Turkish (not found in Arabic), which likely stemmed from confusion with Arabic حَوْلَاء (ḥawlāʔ) (whence Ottoman Turkish حولا (havla)), with which the word شَهْلَاء (šahlāʔ) occurred in Arabic incantations against the evil eye. See evil eye in Turkey.","forms":[{"form":"şehlâ","tags":["alternative"]}]}
