{"word":"yaslamak","pos":"verb","senses":[{"glosses":["to lean, to rest against"],"tags":["transitive"],"synonyms":["dayamak"]}],"pronunciation":"/jas.ɫaˈmak/","etymology":"By surface analysis, yassı (“flat”) + -la (verbalizing suffix). Either a rarely used word that later entered more widespread usage, or a back-formation from yaslanmak (“to lean oneself”), which can be analyzed as its reflexive form. Neither found in Ottoman Turkish dictionaries nor the first edition of the Turkish Language Association's Turkish dictionary; instead, they list یاصدامق (yasdamak) and yastamak, respectively. Compare also yastık (“pillow”)."}
