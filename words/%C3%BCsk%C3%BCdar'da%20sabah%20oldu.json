{"word":"Üsküdar'da sabah oldu","pos":"phrase","senses":[{"glosses":["used when someone is running late"]}],"etymology":"Literally, “it's become morning in Üsküdar”. Said to have originated from the Ottoman period, when the muezzins of the Yeni Valide and Mihrimah Sultan Mosques in Üsküdar would recite the adhan earlier than the ones in Beşiktaş, aiming to attract the attention of the monarch and to get appointed as the muezzin of the palace. As a result, people living in Beşiktaş would be just waking up while the adhan was already being recited in Üsküdar. Thus, people would wake each other up by saying \"it's already the morning time in Üsküdar\"."}
