{"word":"kaka","pos":"noun","senses":[{"glosses":["poop"]}],"etymology":"Nişanyan claims that this word developed by itself as a Lallwort. However, the examples he gives of how this word is imitating the sounds of people defecating are all from Indo-European languages, with their reconstructed ancestor being Proto-Indo-European *kakka- (“to defecate”). This, combined with how other Turkic languages don't have a word of the same origin and meaning, makes it much more likely that this is instead a borrowing. If so, most likely from Greek κακά (kaká).\nCompare Finnish kakka and Estonian kaka, other non-Indo-European languages in close contact with Indo-European ones, bearing similar words that were seemingly not inherited from their proto-languages.","forms":[{"form":"kakayı","tags":["accusative","definite"]},{"form":"kakalar","tags":["plural"]},{"form":"no-table-tags","tags":["table-tags"]},{"form":"tr-infl-noun-v","tags":["inflection-template"]},{"form":"kaka","tags":["nominative","singular"]},{"form":"kakalar","tags":["nominative","plural"]},{"form":"kakayı","tags":["accusative","definite","singular"]},{"form":"kakaları","tags":["accusative","definite","plural"]},{"form":"kakaya","tags":["dative","singular"]},{"form":"kakalara","tags":["dative","plural"]},{"form":"kakada","tags":["locative","singular"]},{"form":"kakalarda","tags":["locative","plural"]},{"form":"kakadan","tags":["ablative","singular"]},{"form":"kakalardan","tags":["ablative","plural"]},{"form":"kakanın","tags":["genitive","singular"]},{"form":"kakaların","tags":["genitive","plural"]}]}
