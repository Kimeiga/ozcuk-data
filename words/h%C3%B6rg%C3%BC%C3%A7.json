{"word":"hörgüç","pos":"noun","senses":[{"glosses":["hump (of a camel)"]},{"glosses":["hump, bump"],"tags":["figuratively"]}],"etymology":"From a derivation of older ör- (“to rise”). Initial h sound is peculiar and comparable to Azerbaijani hörmək and Salar fürgüsi in which any trace of initial long vowels would be lost. Also compare höyük from the same root."}
